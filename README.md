# Rust ASCII Donut Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a rotating ASCII art donut in Rust. It demonstrates the use of mathematical formulas and character shading to create a visually interesting effect using only text characters in the terminal. This project is inspired by the classic "Donut Math" coding challenge and serves as an exploration of Rust's capabilities in handling mathematical calculations, terminal output, and real-time rendering.

## Features

- ASCII Art Rendering: Generates a rotating donut shape using ASCII characters.
- Real-Time Animation: Smooth animation of the donut rotation in the terminal.
- Mathematically Driven: Utilizes mathematical concepts to calculate the points on a torus and transform them for 2D rendering.
- Terminal-Based: Designed to run in a terminal or console window.

## Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lvllvl/donut.git
cd donut
```

## Usage
